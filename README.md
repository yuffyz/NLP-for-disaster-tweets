# NLP for Disaster Tweets

This project is my version of reproducing the work of a research paper submitted August 12, 2016 by a team of reserachers from Qatar Computing Research Institute: ["Rapid Classification of Crisis-Related Data on Social Networks using Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03902) by Dat Tien Nguyen, Kamela Ali Al Mannai, Shafiq Joty, Hassan Sajjad, Muhammad Imran, Prasenjit Mitra.

## What this paper is about? 

This paper introduced neural network based classification methods for binary and multi-class tweet classification task. It makes use of out-of-event data in the early hours of a disaster and achieved a better result with CNN (compared to RF, LR, and SVM)


## What did I do and why? 

I reproduce this paper for learning purpose to get myself more proficient with text mining techniques and gain a deeper understanding of neural nets. 

Techniques, models and concepts used and explained in this project are: 

* preprocessing techniques for text data
* tokenization 
* word vector and embeddings
* word2vec
* Bag of words model 
* Tagging 
* TFIDF
* PCA
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Network
* Clustering 

## How to use the program

To view the result,  I built a web server that displays
